#this project uses dijkstra algorithm to find shortest distance between two points or locations in grid.
#since in dijkstra algorithm we uses priority queue for getting shorter distance at each step but here in javascript we are using array by sorting it so that at each step we get the shortest distance and finally reaching at destination node we overall get the shortest distance between the two given locations.
#Note --  here each cells of the grid is being treated as  graph node and and the dijkstra algorithm is being applied to find the shortest distance between any two points in grid.
